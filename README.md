## RSRS Special Issue: Innovation in Regional Graphics 

### *An Exploration of Regional Retail Mobility during the COVID-19 Pandemic*

### Introduction 

This repo contains all the code used to produce the main visualisation for this submission to this special issue in Regional Studies, Regional Science. Regional graphics can be incredibly powerful tools for telling stories and making arguments about the state of regions and regionalism. This special issue is a compilation of some of the best examples of the format. We are inviting scholars from any discipline to contribute visualisations (maps, infographics, charts, or other forms of spatial visualisations) that address topics conceptualised at the regional scale. For more info on the special issue, see the call for papers [HERE](https://www.regionalstudies.org/special_issue/rsrs-innovation-in-regional-graphics/).

In out submission we adopt a regional approach, focusing on the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as a case study, to explore changes to retail mobility during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from SafeGraph, we calculate retail mobility - total visits to retail stores - for a six-week period during the 'first peak' of the pandemic (02/03 - 06/04), and map weekly change in retail mobility at an aggregated hexagonal spatial index - H3. The data used is not openly available, but can be accessed via [SafeGraph](https://www.safegraph.com/covid-19-data-consortium#:~:text=SafeGraph%20is%20providing%20free%20access,COVID%2D19%20(Coronavirus)). The code used to produce this visualisation can be found [HERE](insert url).
