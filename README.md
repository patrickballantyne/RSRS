## RSRS Special Issue: Innovation in Regional Graphics 

### Introduction 
This repo contains all the code used to produce the main visualisation for this submission to this special issue in Regional Studies, Regional Science. Regional graphics can be incredibly powerful tools for telling stories and making arguments about the state of regions and regionalism. This special issue is a compilation of some of the best examples of the format. We are inviting scholars from any discipline to contribute visualisations (maps, infographics, charts, or other forms of spatial visualisations) that address topics conceptualised at the regional scale. For more info on the special issue, see the call for papers: [here](https://www.regionalstudies.org/special_issue/rsrs-innovation-in-regional-graphics/)

In this paper we adopt a regional approach, focusing on the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as a case study, to explore changes to retail mobility during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from SafeGraph, we calculate retail mobility - total visits to retail stores - for a six-week period during the 'first peak' of the pandemic (02/03 - 06/04), and map weekly change in retail mobility at an aggregated hexagonal spatial index - H3. The code used to produce this graphic can be found here, with thanks the authors of 'tmap' (Martijn Tennekes and team) and 'magick' (Jeroen Ooms), which are the key packages used to produce this visualisation.
